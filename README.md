### **Fashion AI: Outfit Matcher**  

This project is a **multimodal fashion recommendation system** using **Google Gemini AI** and a **Pandas-based CSV database**. It analyzes an uploaded outfit image, detects **style, color, and gender suitability**, and autonomously recommends matching fashion items.  

### **Current Setup:**  
- **Backend:** Python-based, using `pandas` for handling product data (`products.csv`).  
- **AI Model:** **Gemini-Pro Vision** for image analysis and text-based recommendations.  
- **Interface:** Built with **Streamlit** for an easy-to-use UI.  
- **Database:** Simple CSV-based product storage (to be upgraded).  

### **Why is it Agentic AI?**  
✅ **Autonomous Decision-Making:** Analyzes images, extracts outfit attributes, and fetches recommendations **without human input**.  
✅ **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Uses Gemini **to interpret fashion characteristics** and matches them with the product catalog.  
✅ **Adaptability:** If no exact match is found, it **dynamically suggests alternatives** based on similar styles.  
✅ **Multi-Modality:** Currently **image-to-text**, but can be expanded to **voice and interactive dialogues** with Gemini.  

### **Planned Upgrades (GCP-Focused):**  
1️⃣ **BigQuery & Firestore:** Replace CSV storage with **BigQuery** for scalable analytics and **Firestore** for real-time product updates.  
2️⃣ **Cloud Vision API:** Improve image analysis using **Google Cloud Vision** for better feature extraction.  
3️⃣ **Cloud Functions & Pub/Sub:** Automate AI-triggered recommendations using **Cloud Functions + Pub/Sub**.  
4️⃣ **Vertex AI Deployment:** Host the **Gemini AI model** on **Vertex AI** for scalable inference.  
5️⃣ **Cloud Run:** Deploy the backend using **Cloud Run** for a **serverless and scalable solution**.  

### **Future Agentic Enhancements (for Hackathon)** 🚀  
💬 **Conversational Shopping Assistant:** Implement **Gemini’s memory** for a **chat-based personalized shopping experience**.  
📊 **Automated Trend Analysis:** Use **Google Trends API + Gemini** to **suggest trending styles dynamically**.  
🎨 **Dynamic Styling Suggestions:** Integrate **Gemini Code AI** to **generate outfit combinations on the fly**.  
👕 **Virtual Try-On (Future Vision):** Use **ARCore + AI-generated previews** for an **interactive dressing room experience**.  

This project **already aligns with the Agentic AI principles** required for the **Gemini Agentic AI Hackathon**, with a clear **roadmap for further GCP-powered advancements**! 🚀🔥
